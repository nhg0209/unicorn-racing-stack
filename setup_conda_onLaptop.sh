# setup_conda_onLaptop.sh — sim-only / laptop setup.
#
# Same as setup_conda_onCar.sh, but first marks the HARDWARE-only packages with
# COLCON_IGNORE so colcon skips them, while keeping the bits a laptop still needs:
#   - skip: urg_node (lidar driver), vesc_driver/vesc_ackermann/vesc (motor HW),
#           particle_filter (on-car localization).
#   - keep: vesc_msgs (so you can `ros2 topic echo` VESC messages), and the full
#           cartographer stack incl. cartographer_rviz (to view submaps in RViz —
#           cartographer_rviz depends on cartographer + cartographer_ros{,_msgs}).
#
#   conda activate base      # (or have conda/mamba on PATH)
#   ./setup_conda_onLaptop.sh
#
# To go back to a full (car) build on this checkout, just run
# ./setup_conda_onCar.sh — it clears these COLCON_IGNORE files on a direct run.
