    Anchoring at x_N created an anchor-less positive-feedback loop: a lateral

    drifted point → pulled x_N further out, so ec grew monotonically

    track arc length breaks the loop while keeping the attractor one horizon
    ahead (the forward-progress carrot the horizon-end query was reaching for).

    The look-ahead is the predicted travel v·N·dT, floored at `lookahead_floor`
